- **Recipe Inspirations**: Leftover ingredients got you stumped? Upload a picture and our AI will suggest delicious recipes to whip up, minimizing food waste and unleashing your culinary creativity.

- **Community Chat**: Build trust and connect with fellow food savers through an integrated chat feature. Discuss item details, arrange pickups, or simply share your passion for sustainability.
