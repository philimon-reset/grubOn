Grub On tackles food waste and fosters community connections by allowing individuals and businesses to share or sell surplus food. Users can easily list and discover various food items, from groceries to home-cooked meals, through an interactive map. An AI-powered freshness checker helps users assess quality, while upcoming features like grocery tracking and recipe inspiration further minimize waste.

While the application is not released yet, users can build the application by typing:

```
flutter build apk
```

- **Recipe Inspirations**: Leftover ingredients got you stumped? Upload a picture and our AI will suggest delicious recipes to whip up, minimizing food waste and unleashing your culinary creativity.

- **Community Chat**: Build trust and connect with fellow food savers through an integrated chat feature. Discuss item details, arrange pickups, or simply share your passion for sustainability.
